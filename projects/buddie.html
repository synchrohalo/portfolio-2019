                        <p>People with social anxiety tend to have trouble making friends because of the discomfort they feel in social situations, for a variety of reasons and insecurities. <em>Issues related to this condition include a lack of trust between them and strangers,  or simply not knowing what to say in a conversation with someone new.</em></p>

                <h3>Doing the homework</h3>

                <!-- SURVEY -->
                <div class="substep survey">
                    <h4>User survey</h4>
                    <p>From the start, I knew that finding people specific to my demographic would be a little difficult, not only because it’s potentially a sensitive topic but because I also have no way to confirm whether participants actually have social anxiety. I turned to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SampleSize/" class="link" target="_blank">r/SampleSize</a> on Reddit to get my survey out to a larger audience and accepted responses on a trust basis.</p>

                    <div class="focus">
                        <h5>Key insights</h5>
                        <div class="focus-body">
                            <ul class="list">
                                <li><p><em>Shared interests</em> is considered the most important quality when forming a bond with a new friend.</p></li>
                                <li><p><em>Not knowing what to say</em> is the number one fear participants have when communicating with new people.</p></li>
                                <li><p>Finally, participants are fueled by <em>the power of words</em>, whether through validation or encouragement to follow through with a meetup.</p></li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <p>Another big problem that came to my attention was figuring out how to make the app <em>a safe, comfortable space for users</em>, especially for women and genderqueer people who are subject to sexual harassment. Forgetting to ask about gender and gender-related dynamics in a social app was a huge oversight on my part; I was grateful for the multiple instances of write-in answers pertaining to harassment and “creeps”.</p>

                    <p>I used my surveys to construct two distinct personas, one who prefers to meet people online and one who prefers to meet people offline.</p>

                <!-- COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS -->
                <div class="substep competitive-analysis">
                    <h4>Competitive analysis</h4>

                    <img class="small-img" src="../img/buddie/competitive-analysis.png" alt="Meetup.com logo" />

                    <p>As far as I could tell, there were no direct competitors to the app I had in mind, and so I looked to apps that were tangentially-related, namely ones focused on forming friendships or ones involving mental health and meditation.</p>

                    <p>In the end, I felt that <a class="link" href="https://www.meetup.com/" target="_blank">Meetup.com</a> best captured what I had in mind. Based on the research, people are more likely to make friends based on mutual interests, and so I wanted to create a similar platform using interest groups.</p>

                    <p>Though I didn’t conduct a formal analysis of it, I also looked to <a class="link" href="https://www.reddit.com/" target="_blank">Reddit</a> as inspiration for discussion boards, a feature that would target the persona type that doesn’t mind keeping relationships online.</p>

                    <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_qHdIWPJKACfKrlxc6nsNFnLsxjDe-MwLvjP4x-MUuc/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank"><button class="active fade-to-color">View full analysis</button></a>

                    <h4>Synthesizing information</h4>
                    <p>I did a <a class="link" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YWuKTIZ0mCXtayRW1uC5av-rL72TM7mGuJ6mGN_5vEk/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">How Might We</a> exercise to brainstorm solutions to the pain points I found from analyzing my survey results. From here, I created a list of user stories that I organized into categories based on similarity. These stories would form my MVP.</p>

                    <img src="../img/buddie/mvp.png" alt="MVP diagram" />

                    <p>I simplified the tasks to create flows for each user story and turned the user stories into features to form a mock information architecture for my app.</p>

                    <!--<img class="" src="../img/buddie/user-flows.png" alt="User flows" />

                    <p>I then took the user stories and turned them into features </p>-->

                    <h4>Wireframes</h4>
                    <p>I took a different approach than I was used to -- right after making rough sketches, I made quick digital wireframes using <a href="https://whimsical.com/" class="link" target="_blank">Whimsical</a>. With Whimsical, ready-made components are easily dragged and dropped onto a frame. At the speed of sketching, I was able to come up with screens of a fidelity that requires less explanation than that of unrefined sketches.</p>

                    <p>While one participant was going through the “Block user” flow, they mentioned that the word “block” might come off as unfriendly, especially for an app targeting people with social anxiety. They went on to say that they’d wished there were more “positive” options listed alongside blocking, so as to give the app a more welcoming feel. I kept this idea of positivity in mind as I improved upon my app.</p>

The primary app colors are restrained to neutrals and two values of green, while the rest of the colors are a little more saturated to imitate the <em>vibrancy of fully bloomed flowers</em>, serving to accentuate certain components and create contrast where needed.</p>

                    <p>I chose <em>Amiko</em> for body text and <em>HK Grotesk</em> for headings. Amiko’s delicate strokes play well with the plant imagery, while HK Grotesk has a friendly look that eases users into a comfortable state.</p>

                    <h4>Illustration</h4>
                    <p>I likened people with social anxiety to <em>buds that are yearning to bloom into their true selves</em>. The sun is warming and nurturing in the way that friendship and healthy social interactions can help people grow. I used simple, imperfect-looking (as opposed to symmetrical and balanced) illustrations to demonstrate how diverse human beings are.</p>

                    <img class="large-img" src="../img/buddie/hi-fi.png" alt="new screens" />
                    <p>I applied my newly-established branding to create high-fidelity screens. Here, I also tried a different approach from how I usually work. Normally I create my prototypes screen by screen. This time, I started with making small components first, in an attempt to mimic the process behind <a href="https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/" class="link" target="_blank">atomic design</a> (with the visual elements, at least).</p>

                    <img class="large-img" src="../img/buddie/components.png" alt="components" />

                    <p>Chalk it up to my lack of understanding design systems, but as I started to put together each screen, I found that my components were either insufficient or too different from other iOS apps with similar patterns. <a href="https://mobbin.design/" class="link" target="_blank">Mobbin.design</a> was a great reference for seeing how other apps tackle common patterns/features and helped me to figure out how to cement my “building blocks” together.</p>

                <!-- TESTING -->
                <div class="substep hifi-test">
                    <h4>Testing</h4>
                    <p>I asked users to complete the same tasks from the previous round of testing with the changes reflected in the newly-updated mockups. </p>

                    <div class="focus">
                        <h5>Takeaways</h5>
                        <div class="focus-body focus-list">
                            <ul class="list">
                                <li><p><em>Limit options</em> as people with anxiety may have a harder time making a decision.</p></li>
                                <li><p>Focus on creating a <em>positive tone</em> and ways to make sure that the community is warm and inviting.</p></li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <p>In more than one instance, testers indicated that the text fields used in the <span class="italic">Reflection</span> and <span class="italic">Affirmation</span> features can be overwhelming, and users may feel at a loss for what to type, even when given a prompt. This was possibly related to the insight from my original survey that <em>not knowing what to say</em> was one of the most common issues participants faced.</p>

                    <div class="two-col">
                        <div class="col-1">
                            <img class="border" src="../img/buddie/reflect-old.png" alt="Mobile version of landing page with backpack-wearing bear illustration" />
                        </div>
                        <div class="col-2">
                            <img class="border" src="../img/buddie/affirmation-old.png" alt="Mobile version of dashboard, with upload button in the bottom right corner" />
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <p>One tester cited an app called <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/moodnotes-thought-journal/id1019230398?ls=1" class="link" target="_blank">Moodnotes</a> as a good example of journaling with a built-in mood detection feature. Perhaps a bit too complex, I was instead inspired by a more simple feature in which users are prompted to answer how they are feeling by swiping the mouth’s curvature up or down.</p>

                    <img class="app" src="../img/buddie/moodnotes.png" alt="moodnotes" />

                    <p>This got me thinking about how I could more effectively get people to think about how they feel. I came up with a solution of providing Buddie users with a fixed list from which to choose. The list is constructed from the <em>six basic emotions</em>, each of which expands into a selection of more descriptive options (based on this <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/64182/improve-your-vocabulary-wheel-feelings" class="link" target="_blank">emotion wheel</a>).</p>

                    <div class="two-col">
                        <div class="col-1">
                            <img class="border" src="../img/buddie/hifi-reflect-new.png" alt="Mobile version of landing page with backpack-wearing bear illustration" />
                        </div>
                        <div class="col-2">

                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <p>Similarly, I modified <span class="italic">Affirmations</span> to include a selection of badges to present to event attendees of a user’s choice. Each badge is associated with a list of premade messages, akin to a greeting card, as suggested by a user in the previous round of testing.</p>

                    <div class="two-col">
                        <div class="col-1">

                            <p>With the recurring mention of a positive tone, I hoped that my update of <span class="italic">Affirmations</span> could ensure a positive experience for all who’ve made it as far to attend an event through the platform. One tester felt that there should be some way to provide feedback on received affirmations, and I thought that by limiting it to compliment-only options, I could bypass the possibility of any hurtful messages.</p>

                    <h3>Outcome</h3>
                    <p>From the beginning, I was afraid that my all of my ideas would culminate into an app so generalized that it wouldn’t even remotely address the issues that people with social anxiety face. Though it’s hard to test the validity of the end product without a larger audience, I was happy to find that the testers who did have social anxiety were receptive to the idea of Buddie and praised the inclusion of <em>Reflection and Affirmation features</em> -- the two features which could set the app apart from other social platforms.</p>

                    <p>On the technical side, I was able to try out new workflows, such as using digital tools for ideating at the lo-fi level and attempting atomic design to create hi-fi prototypes.</p>

                    <div class="focus">
                        <h5>What I learned</h5>
                        <div class="focus-body focus-list">
                            <ul class="list">
                                <li><p><em>Ask about gender (if applicable).</em> Gender, more often than not, is related to sexual harassment, and I failed to ask about it in my first survey. With a social app that involves meeting strangers, sexual harassment is something that’s bound to be an issue. I wish I’d learned more about how my female and genderqueer demographic interacts online before proceeding with the app creation.</p></li>
                                <li><p><em>Apps aren’t always the answer.</em> While getting feedback on my high-fidelity prototype, a tester recounted an experience during a social dancing class where dancers used colored wristbands to indicate whether or not they are interested in dancing with a partner. I thought this could potentially be a good non-verbal solution to helping event-goers draw a line (if they wish) between themselves and others without having to shut anyone down. This also reminded me that you can’t solve everything with an app -- sometimes the best solutions can be found in the real world.</p></li>
                                <li><p><em>Think, but don’t think too hard.</em> Sometimes thinking is the antithesis of getting things done. For a long time I was stuck on the fact that I was using my survey to create a laundry list of features to include in the app rather than using the results to create something more I felt was more “meaningful”. I might have gathered information more quickly if the time I’d spent thinking went to creating a prototype that I could test with actual users.</p></li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>

                    <h3>Next steps</h3>
                    <p>If I were to continue with the project, I would:</p>

                    <div class="focus">
                        <div class="focus-body focus-list">
                            <ul class="list">
                                <li><p><em>Interview female and genderqueer populations</em> to learn more about how to create a safe space and better prevent harassment. </p></li>
                                <li><p><em>Create a more expansive Friend feature</em> in which users can see which friends are going to which events.</p></li>
                                <li><p><em>Work carefully on copy</em> and establish a brand language that feels friendly and accommodating.</p></li>
                                <li><p><em>Use more icons and illustrations</em> to make things easier to process for users.</p></li>
                                <li><p><em>Simplify options</em>, such as cutting down on the number of emoji reacts, so that users with anxiety feel less pressure when making a decision.</p></li>
                                <li><p><em>Expand on the features specific to social anxiety</em> so that the app is more specialized for its target audience.</p></li>
                                <li><p><em>Test, test, test</em>.</p></li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <p>The list goes on. But, for now, I’m elated to have created something that not only touches on my own personal issues but could very well help someone else.</p>
                    <p>Thanks for reading.</p>
