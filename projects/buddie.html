        <h1>Social anxiety app</h1>
        <p>Inspired by the idea of using technology to connect lonely people, I set out to design an app that specializes in bringing together people with social anxiety. The result is a social platform akin to <em>Meetup</em> with an emphasis on positivity.</p>

                        <h3>The problem</h3>
                        <p>People with social anxiety tend to have trouble making friends because of the discomfort they feel in social situations, for a variety of reasons and insecurities. <em>Issues related to this condition include a lack of trust between them and strangers,  or simply not knowing what to say in a conversation with someone new.</em></p>

                        <p>Buddie is a place where locals with social anxiety can connect based on interests, bond over anxiety triumphs, and even meet in person if it gets that far. <em>The app focuses on validation, mindfulness, and providing a sense of safety to give users an environment in which they can grow and overcome the hurdles that social anxiety creates.</em></p>

            <!-- USER RESEARCH -->
            <section class="research">
                <h3 class="step-title"><span class="purple">01</span> Research</h3>
                <h3>Doing the homework</h3>

                <p>Research was the first item on my to-do list. I needed to get to know the demographic, learn more about similar apps in the market, and organize my findings in a meaningful way.</p>

                <!-- SURVEY -->
                <div class="substep survey">
                    <h4>User survey</h4>
                    <p>Initially, I faced two obstacles when seeking participants specific to my demographic: 1) it is a sensitive topic and 2) there is no way to confirm they actually have social anxiety. I turned to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SampleSize/" class="link" target="_blank">r/SampleSize</a> on Reddit to get my survey out to a larger audience and accepted responses on a trust basis.</p>

                    <div class="focus">
                        <h5>Key insights</h5>
                        <div class="focus-body">
                            <ul class="list">
                                <li><p><em>Shared interests</em> is considered the most important quality when forming a bond with a new friend.</p></li>
                                <li><p><em>Not knowing what to say</em> is the number one fear participants have when communicating with new people.</p></li>
                                <li><p>Finally, participants are fueled by <em>the power of words</em>, whether through validation or encouragement to follow through with a meetup.</p></li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <p>Another big problem that came to my attention was figuring out how to make the app <em>a safe, comfortable space for users</em>, especially for women and genderqueer people who are subject to sexual harassment. Forgetting to ask about gender and gender-related dynamics in a social app was a huge oversight on my part; I was grateful for the multiple instances of write-in answers pertaining to harassment and “creeps”.</p>

                    <p>I used my surveys to construct two distinct personas, one who prefers to meet people <em>online</em> and one who prefers to meet people <em>offline</em>.</p>

                <!-- COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS -->
                <div class="substep competitive-analysis">
                    <h4>Competitive analysis</h4>

                    <img class="small-img" src="../img/buddie/competitive-analysis.png" alt="Meetup.com and Reddit logos" />

                    <p>As far as I could tell, there were no direct competitors to the app I had in mind, and so I looked to apps that were tangentially-related, namely ones focused on forming friendships or ones involving mental health and meditation.</p>

                    <p>In the end, I felt that <a class="link" href="https://www.meetup.com/" target="_blank">Meetup.com</a> best captured what I had in mind. Based on the research, people are more likely to make friends based on mutual interests, and so I wanted to create a similar platform using interest groups.</p>

                    <p>Though I didn’t conduct a formal analysis of it, I also looked to <a class="link" href="https://www.reddit.com/" target="_blank">Reddit</a> as inspiration for discussion boards, a feature that would target the persona type that doesn’t mind keeping relationships online.</p>

                    <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/14bok-PXVaCh2gBO3FOI75sT01GnieN4Q1ly0_3_rpYA/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank"><button class="active fade-to-color">View full analysis</button></a>

                    <h4>Synthesizing information</h4>
                    <p>I did a <a class="link" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YWuKTIZ0mCXtayRW1uC5av-rL72TM7mGuJ6mGN_5vEk/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">How Might We</a> exercise to brainstorm solutions to the pain points I found from analyzing my survey results. From here, I created a list of user stories that I organized into categories based on similarity. These stories would form my MVP.</p>

                    <img src="../img/buddie/mvp.png" alt="MVP diagram" />

                    <p>I simplified the tasks to create flows for each user story and turned the user stories into features to form a mock information architecture for my app.</p>

                    <!--<img class="" src="../img/buddie/user-flows.png" alt="User flows" />

                    <p>I then took the user stories and turned them into features </p>-->

                    <p>I tried a new approach here &mdash; right after making rough sketches, I made quick digital wireframes using <a href="https://whimsical.com/" class="link" target="_blank">Whimsical</a>. With Whimsical, I could easily drag and drop ready-made components onto a mobile phone template. At the speed of sketching, I could build screens of a fidelity that requires less explanation than that of unrefined sketches.</p>

                    <p>When asked to block a user, one participant mentioned that the word “block” might come off as unfriendly, especially for an app targeting people with social anxiety. They went on to say that they’d wished there were more “positive” options listed alongside blocking so as to give the app a more welcoming feel. I kept this idea of positivity in mind as I improved upon my app.</p>

                <h3>A prototype with polish</h3>
                <p>The first step in upgrading the visual design of the wireframes was to establish a simple style guide and get a handle on the branding.</p>

                    <p>I likened people with social anxiety to <em>buds that are yearning to bloom into their true selves</em>. The sun is warming and nurturing in the way that friendship and healthy social interactions can help people grow. I used simple, imperfect-looking (as opposed to symmetrical and balanced) illustrations to demonstrate how diverse human beings are.</p>

                    <p>I selected a subdued palette to maintain a calm and relaxing experience. The primary app colors are restrained to neutrals and two values of green, while the rest of the colors are a little more saturated to imitate the <em>vibrancy of fully bloomed flowers</em>, serving to accentuate certain components and create contrast where needed.</p>

                <div class="substep type">
                    <h4>Typography</h4>
                    <p>I chose <em>Amiko</em> for body text and <em>HK Grotesk</em> for headings. Amiko’s delicate strokes play well with the plant imagery, while HK Grotesk has a friendly look that eases users into a comfortable state.</p>

                    <img class="small-img" src="../img/buddie/type.svg" alt="Type hierarchy showing the fonts HK Grotesk and Amiko" />

                    </div>

                    <h4>Illustration</h4>
                    <p>I developed illustrations with the idea of buds in mind. I tried to take the flower imagery a little further, placing the buds in simple scenes reminscent of a garden.</p>

                    <img id="bud" src="../img/buddie/illustration-3.svg" alt="Illustration of three buds smiling, being warmed under the sun" />

                <!-- SCREENS -->

                    <img class="large-img" src="../img/buddie/hi-fi.png" alt="Hi-fi mockups showing the different tab screens" />
                    <p>I applied my newly-established branding to create high-fidelity screens. Normally I create my prototypes screen by screen. This time, I started with making small components first, in an attempt to mimic the process behind <a href="https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/" class="link" target="_blank">atomic design</a> (with the visual elements, at least).</p>

                    <img class="large-img" src="../img/buddie/components.png" alt="Components organized into features and sub-features, used to make the hi-fi design" />

                    <p>As I started to put together each screen, I found that my components were either insufficient or too different from other iOS apps with similar patterns. <a href="https://mobbin.design/" class="link" target="_blank">Mobbin.design</a> was a great reference for seeing how other apps tackle common patterns/features and helped me to figure out how to cement my “building blocks” together.</p>

                <!-- TESTING -->
                <div class="substep hifi-test">
                    <h4>Testing</h4>
                    <p>I asked users to complete the same tasks from the previous round of testing with the changes reflected in the newly-updated mockups. </p>

                    <div class="focus">
                        <h5>Takeaways</h5>
                        <div class="focus-body focus-list">
                            <ul class="list">
                                <li><p><em>Limit options</em> as people with anxiety may have a harder time making a decision.</p></li>
                                <li><p>Focus on creating a <em>positive tone</em> and ways to make sure that the community is warm and inviting.</p></li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <p>In more than one instance, testers indicated that the text fields used in the <span class="italic">Reflection</span> and <span class="italic">Affirmation</span> features can be overwhelming, and users may feel at a loss for what to type, even when given a prompt. This was possibly related to the insight from my original survey that <em>not knowing what to say</em> was one of the most common issues participants faced.</p>

                    <div class="two-col">
                        <div class="col-1">
                            <img class="border" src="../img/buddie/reflect-old.png" alt="Old Reflection screen example asking user how they felt before an event, with a text field underneath" />
                        </div>
                        <div class="col-2">

                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <p>One tester cited an app called <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/moodnotes-thought-journal/id1019230398?ls=1" class="link" target="_blank">Moodnotes</a> as a good example of mood journaling. One feature caught my eye, where users are prompted to answer how they are feeling by swiping the mouth’s curvature up or down.</p>

                    <img class="app" src="../img/buddie/moodnotes.png" alt="Moodnotes app screen asking user how they are, where user can answer by swiping a face's smile up or down" />

                    <p>This got me thinking about how I could more effectively get people to think about how they feel. I constructed a fixed list of the <em>six basic emotions</em>, each of which expands into a selection of more descriptive options (based on this <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/64182/improve-your-vocabulary-wheel-feelings" class="link" target="_blank">emotion wheel</a>).</p>

                    <div class="two-col">
                        <div class="col-1">
                            <img class="border" src="../img/buddie/hifi-reflect-new.png" alt="New Reflection screen where user can choose from different moods: Happy, Surprise, Fear, Anger, Disgust, Sadness" />
                        </div>

                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <p>Similarly, I modified <span class="italic">Affirmations</span> to include a selection of badges to present to event attendees of a user’s choice. Each badge is associated with a list of premade messages, akin to a greeting card, as suggested by a user in the previous round of testing.</p>

                    <div class="two-col">
                        <div class="col-1">

                            <p>I hoped that the new <span class="italic">Affirmations</span> feature would address the request for an overwall positive tone. One tester felt that there should be some way to review received affirmations, and so I came up with a list of preset compliments to prevent the need for feedback.</p>

                    <h3>Outcome</h3>
                    <p>At first I was afraid that my all of my ideas would culminate into an app so generalized, it wouldn’t remotely address any struggles associated with social anxiety.</p> 

                    <p>In spite of the difficulties I faced mid-creation, however, I was happy to find that testers who did have social anxiety were receptive to the idea of Buddie and praised the inclusion of <em>Reflection and Affirmation features</em>, the two features which could set the app apart from other social platforms.</p>

                    <p>On the technical side, I was able to try out new workflows, such as using digital tools for ideating at the lo-fi level and trying my hand at creating components first while working on my hi-fi prototypes.</p>

                    <div class="focus">
                        <h5>What I learned</h5>
                        <div class="focus-body focus-list">
                            <ul class="list">
                                <li><p><em>Ask about gender (if applicable).</em> With a social app that involves meeting strangers, sexual harassment is something that’s bound to be an issue. I wish I’d learned more about how my female and genderqueer demographic interacts online before proceeding with the app creation.</p></li>
                                <li><p><em>Apps aren’t always the answer.</em> One tester recounted an experience during a social dancing class in which dancers use colored wristbands to indicate whether or not they are interested in dancing with a partner. This reminded me that you can’t solve everything with an app, and that you have to think outside of the box to find real-world solutions.</p></li>
                                <li><p><em>Think, but don’t think too hard.</em> Sometimes thinking is the antithesis of getting things done. I was too afraid to make decisions that I wasted time thinking about what to do instead of taking action.</p></li>
                            </ul>

                    <h3>Next steps</h3>
                    <p>If I were to continue with the project, I would:</p>

                    <div class="focus">
                        <div class="focus-body focus-list">
                            <ul class="list">
                                <li><p><em>Interview more women and genderqueer populations</em> to learn more about how to create a safe space and better prevent harassment. </p></li>
                                <li><p><em>Create a more expansive Friend feature</em> in which users can see which friends are going to which events.</p></li>
                                <li><p><em>Work carefully on copy</em> and establish a brand language that feels friendly and accommodating.</p></li>
                                <li><p><em>Use more icons and illustrations</em> to make things easier to process for users.</p></li>
                                <li><p><em>Simplify options</em>, such as cutting down on the number of emoji reacts, so that users with anxiety feel less pressure when making a decision.</p></li>
                                <li><p><em>Expand on the features specific to social anxiety</em> so that the app is more specialized for its target audience.</p></li>
                                <li><p><em>Test, test, test</em>.</p></li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <p>The list goes on. But, for now, I’m elated to have created something that not only touches on my own personal issues but could very well help someone else.</p>
