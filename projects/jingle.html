        <p>Between June 4 to June 14, 2019, I attempted the Adobe XD Daily Creative challenge to familiarize myself with the program. The brief for this circuit was to design the UI for a food delivery app, similar to Caviar, Postmates, and the like. I chose to focus my app on ice cream delivery under the name Jingle.</p>

                    <p>This was a quick and fun project that helped me get accustomed to Adobe XD (which, at this time of writing, is now my prototyping tool of choice). One of the highlights was getting to experiment with the powerful Auto Animate feature, which may have piqued my interest in UI animation.</p>

                                <li><p><em>Emphasize headings</em>   - Upon evaluating my own work, I couldn’t put my finger on why some of my sections were difficult to tell apart. A peer reviewing my type choices pointed out that enlarging and adding weight to the headings would help. I followed her advice with stellar results! It reminded me not to overlook simple solutions that make use of basic design principles.</p></li>
