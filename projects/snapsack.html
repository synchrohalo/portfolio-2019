        <p>I was entrusted to create a cloud storage app, with the task of discovering in what ways a new competitor could enter the cloud storage app market. The result was an app similar to Google Drive and Dropbox, but with the added functionality of labels and a warmer, friendlier interface.</p>

                    <p>I found myself fixated on the last point. It seemed that users were out of the habit of keeping their digital spaces organized.</p>

                    <p>To scope out the competition I selected two cloud storage platforms I was familiar with: Google Drive and Dropbox.</p>

                            <p>The two function similarly, with the main differentiating factor being that <em>Dropbox sees itself as a productivity tool rather than a storage app</em>. Furthermore, the only way to organize files is by moving them between folders (and by selecting folder colors in Drive).</p>
                        </div>

                    <p>Could I improve a cloud storage app in terms of organization? This discovery was pertinent to my growing interest in how to encourage people to organize their digital spaces.</p>

                    <h3>User flows</h3>
                    <p>It was during this stage that I played around more with the idea of labels. I designed my flows under the assumption that folders were a limiting way of navigation and that some sort of labeling or tagging system could help solve two problems that I had with folders:</p>

                    <div class="focus">
                        <h5>Problems with folders</h5>
                        <div class="focus-body focus-list">
                            <ol class="list">
                                <li><p>Hard to access files deeply nested within many folders.</p></li>
                                <li><p>Can only associate a file with one folder and its encapsulating folders.</p></li>
                            </ol>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <p>I also thought about the benefits of using color-coded labels:</p>

                    <div class="focus">
                        <h5>Benefits of labels</h5>
                        <div class="focus-body focus-list">
                            <ol class="list">
                                <li><p>Provide visual cues with the use of color.</p></li>
                                <li><p>Files/folders can be associated with more than one label.</p></li>
                            </ol>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <p>I drafted the following user flows based on the the labeling system developing in my mind. The idea was to used color-coded labels so that users could have a visual cue with which to identify the files and folders on their app.</p>

                    <p>Now that I’d prioritized my user stories and flows, I decided that designing the dashboard first was of the utmost importance. The dashboard is essentially the user’s mission control center. This is where all the action happens.</p>

                    <p>I worked on the branding concurrently with the the wireframes. I developed the brand around the word Snapsack, a play on the word “knapsack” and the phrase “It’s a snap”, referencing the simplicity of the app and how easily accessible files and folders are with the new labeling system.</p>

                    <p>While drawing associations with the backpack mark, imagery of traveling, adventure, and the outdoors formed in my head.

                    <p>With the branding guide in place, I could now successfully begin on my mockups. The first thing I did was to apply the various changes I needed to make from testing the wireframes, mostly a rearrangement of a few features.</p>

                    <h4>Dashboard mockup</h4>

                        <h5>Main changes</h5>
                        <div class="focus-body focus-list">
                            <ul class="list">
                                <li><p><span class="italic">Filter by label</span> moved to top near navigation and above files</p></li>
                                <li><p>Removal of <span class="italic">Add to Snapsack</span> button in favor of placing all upload actions on the sidebar.</p></li>

                            </ul>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <p>I applied <em>Material Design principles</em> for Snapsack’s mobile web app, using a floating action button for the Upload/Create functions and a navigation drawer for access to different parts of the screen.</p>

                    <h4>Mobile mockups</h4>
                    <div class="two-col">

                    </div>

                    <p>In terms of interaction, I added another subtle way of encouraging users to organize their files: upon upload, the user would have the option of adding a label and then be prompted to select a folder into which the item be uploaded.</p>

                    <h4>Select a folder dialog</h4>

                    <p>Organization in cloud storage apps can be improved. There is potential for labels to become a useful tool in terms of how people sort their files and folders.</p>

                    <h3>Looking back</h3>
                    <p>I considered what I could’ve done differently during the process.</p>

                    <div class="focus">
                        <h5>What I would do differently</h5>
                        <div class="focus-body focus-list">
                            <ul class="list">
                                <li><p><em>Focus on the organization aspect of the app.</em> I got too caught up in other features like notes and previewing files that weren’t really fleshed out in the end.</p></li>
                                <li><p><em>Conduct more follow-up research about cloud storage app users and their organization habits.</em> I feel that my survey data wasn’t sufficient due to low participant numbers and lack of foresight regarding the direction the product would take.</p></li>
                                <li><p><em>Consider options on making labels accessible.</em> At the moment, labels are entirely reliant on the user’s ability to perceive colors accurately.</p></li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <p>Building Snapsack was a learning lesson for me in many ways as well, whether about the design process or about the tools I used.</p>

                    <div class="focus">
                        <h5>What I learned</h5>
                        <div class="focus-body focus-list">
                            <ul class="list">
                                <li><p><em>Establishing goals for survey writing is important.</em> My survey reflected that I was unsure about the direction I would go with my project. As a result, the results I got revealed too many gaps of information that I had to “fill in” myself by making assumptions about my audience.</p></li>
                                <li><p><em>Proximity is key.</em> People are more likely to associate two separate items if they are in close proximity with one another. I was too caught up with other details that it slipped my mind to use such a basic principle of design.</p></li>
                                <li><p><em>Don’t use too many components in Figma.</em> When designing my high-fidelity mockups, I nested components within components so that my working file would be as modular as possible (think classes in object-oriented programming). Copying one screen took the app upwards of 2 minutes to complete, and loading each screen of my prototype was awfully slow as well.</p></li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <p>In spite of the setbacks, the positive comments I received post-testing reaffirmed that I was doing something right. <em>A labeling system is a relatively simple feature that cloud storage apps could use to encourage their users to keep their digital spaces neat.</em> Folders are “enough” but don’t provide much in the way of visual cues or non-linear access to files. Filtering by labels could be the answer to finding files easily.<br /><br />
