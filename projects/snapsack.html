                    <p>To scope out the competition I selected two cloud storage platforms I was familiar with: Google Drive and Dropbox.

                    <p>I also saw that there was <em>no way to organize files in any other way than by moving them between folders (and by selecting folder colors in Drive)</em>. Could I improve a cloud storage app on this front? This fact was pertinent to my growing interest in how to encourage people to organize their digital spaces.</p>

                    <h3>Wireframes</h3>

                    <p>I started working on digital wireframes based on the previous suggestions. I moved all of the the upload and create functions into a button labeled “Add to my Snapsack” and placed it in the bottom right corner for easy access.</p> 

                    <p>I also shifted around some of the other elements on the menu bar. During this process, I had the idea of displaying the labels in a list à la Projects on the app <a href="https://todoist.com/?lang=en" target="_blank"><span class="link">Todoist</span></a>:</p>

                    <img class="smallest-img" src="../img/snapsack/todoist.png" />

                    <p>I wanted the labels to be visible so that the user had a visual key with which to reference the labels attached to their files and folders. The user would be able to check off labels on the side to filter their view. Because this would take an indefinite amount of vertical space, I switched <span class="italic">Filter by label</span> with the contextual file menu so that it would have more space to expand.

                    <p>The side menu was looking a bit empty with just Filter by label, so I decided to move the user profile picture and storage space to the top right, giving the top left of the dashboard more breathing room.</p>

                <div class="text">
                    <p>As I started considering the labeling functionality, some questions came to mind. Would the user be limited to filtering their files with only one label? What if the user wanted to filter by multiple labels? </p>
                    <p>While digging deeper into those scenarios, I ran into a problem. Would selecting two labels mean that the user wants to see files/folders that include either label or would they prefer to see files/folders that include BOTH labels? I threw both of these options into the mix.</p>
                    <p>Something else I thought about was how labels relate to folders. Would a file necessarily have the same labels as its parent folders? Not so, but would a user like the option to do that as soon as they add a file to a folder? Perhaps. I added that feature as well.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="text">
                    <p>I tested my wireframes with 3 participants, which revealed one commonality &mdash; that the labeling interactions needed some work:</p>

                    <div class="list-in-text">
                        <h4>Labels feedback</h4>
                        <ul class="list">
                            <li><p><span class="italic">“It feels like <em>it should be in the main UI section</em> (top) where search and sort are.”</span> (on where Filter by label should be located)</span></p></li>
                            <li><p><span class="italic">“Sending someone <em>far off to the side of the screen</em> is strange.”</span> (on creating a new label)</p></li>
                            <li><p><span class="italic">“Even though I like seeing the list of labels on the side, I suppose it’s <em>not scalable</em>.”</span> (on the vertical expansion of the labels list)</span></p></li>
                            <li><p><span class="italic">“Use the <em>law of proximity</em> when you can. Add label should be an immediate option next to or over the item in question.”</span> (on adding a label to a file/folder)</p></li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                    <p>It was back to the drawing board for me. I proceeded to sketch more solutions for the label functions.</p>

                    <p>I started to consider how editing labels for a file/folder would work. I imagined a small popup next to the selected file might do the trick.</p>

                    <p>I moved Filter by label to the top in proximity with the search bar because they have similar functions. Because of this, the sidebar was beginning to look too empty. I then thought it would be a perfect place to position the upload functions. I removed the “Add to my Snapsack” button and placed all of the upload/new functions in the bottom left corner as a list. </p>

                    <p>Upon this change, a peer commented, “It’s nice to be able to see the upload options. It’s more explicit this way.” With this approval, I moved on to working on high-fidelity mockups.</p>

                    <p>I developed the brand around the word Snapsack, a potential app name I had in mind early on. The name <em>Snapsack is a play on the word “knapsack” and the phrase “It’s a snap”</em>, a reference to the simplicity of the app and how easily accessible files and folders are with the new labeling system.</p>

                    <p><em>The idea of the backpack lent itself to a few metaphors to cloud storage</em>: a good backpack stores your belongings securely and is meant to be taken with you anywhere. The backpack became the logo, and the user’s storage space became their “Snapsack”.</p>

                    <p>I began making more associations with the backpack, my first thoughts being that of <em>traveling, adventure, and nature</em>. Imagery of the outdoors were forming in my head. It was at this time that I decided the product should feel warm and welcoming; nature isn't always cold and solitary, just as digital products for businesses don't have to be cool and corporate.</p>

                    <p>Another interesting point brought up during testing was that <em>using multiple labels to filter files was probably not a common use case.</em> I admit I might’ve been thinking about it in terms of other disciplines, imagining files as databases that might need a distinction between a union or selection of queried data.

                    <h3>Next steps</h3>
                    <p>Moving forward, the specifics of filtering with labels needs a bit more research. <em>Would users ever need to use more than one label to locate what they need?</em> If so, how often would this use case even apply?</p>

                    <div class="list-in-text">
                        <h4>What I learned</h4>
                        <ul class="list">
                            <li><p><em>Establishing goals for survey writing is important.</em> “Cloud storage app” is a vague term, and my survey reflected that I, too, was unsure of which direction to take with my project. As a result, my survey was weak, and the results I got revealed too many gaps of information that I had to “fill in” myself by making assumptions about my audience.</p></li>
                            <li><p><em>Proximity is key.</em> People are more likely to associate two separate items if they are in close proximity with one another. It’s a basic principle of design, but it can be easy to forget when dealing with a large application.</p></li>
                            <li><p><em>Don’t use too many components in Figma.</em> Though specific to the design tool I used, this proved to be detrimental to my progress, as Figma was not meant to handle this amount of components and nesting. When designing my high-fidelity mockups, I nested components within components so that my working file would be as modular as possible (think classes in object-oriented programming). As a result, copying one screen took the app upwards of 2 minutes to complete, and loading each screen of my prototype was painfully slow as well.</p></li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                    <div class="list-in-text">
                        <h4>What I would do differently</h4>
                        <ul class="list">
                            <li><p><em>Focus on the organization aspect of the app.</em> I got too caught up in other features like notes and previewing files that weren’t really fleshed out in the end. </p></li>
                            <li><p><em>Conduct more follow-up research about cloud storage app users and their organization habits.</em> I feel that my survey data wasn’t sufficient due to low participant numbers and lack of foresight regarding the direction the product would take. </p></li>
                            <li><p><em>Consider options on making labels accessible.</em> At the moment, labels are entirely reliant on the user’s ability to perceive colors accurately.</p></li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <!--- END -->
                <div class="text">
                    <p>In spite of the setbacks, the positive comments I received post-testing reaffirmed that I was doing something right. <em>A labeling system is a relatively simple feature that cloud storage apps could use to encourage their users to keep their digital spaces neat.</em> Folders are “enough” but provide very little in the way of visual cues or non-linear access to files. Filtering by labels could be the answer to finding files easily.</p>
