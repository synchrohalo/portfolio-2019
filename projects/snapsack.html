        <h1>Snapsack</h1>
        <p>I was entrusted to create a cloud storage app, with the task of discovering in what ways a new competitor could enter the cloud storage app market. The result was an app similar to Google Drive and Dropbox, but with the added functionality of labels and a warmer, friendlier interface.</p>

                            <p>The two function similarly, with the main differentiating factor being that <em>Dropbox sees itself as a productivity tool rather than a storage app</em>.

                        </div>

                    <p>Could I improve a cloud storage app in terms of organization? This discovery was pertinent to my growing interest in how to encourage people to organize their digital spaces.</p>

                    <h3>User flows</h3>
                    <p>It was during this stage that I played around more with the idea of labels. I designed my flows under the assumption that folders were a limiting way of navigation and that some sort of labeling or tagging system could help solve two problems that I had with folders:</p>

                    <div class="focus">
                        <h5>Problems with folders</h5>
                        <div class="focus-body focus-list">
                            <ol class="list">
                                <li><p>Hard to access files deeply nested within many folders.</p></li>
                                <li><p>Can only associate a file with one folder and its encapsulating folders.</p></li>
                            </ol>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <p>I also thought about the benefits of using color-coded labels:</p>

                    <div class="focus">
                        <h5>Benefits of labels</h5>
                        <div class="focus-body focus-list">
                            <ol class="list">
                                <li><p>Provide visual cues with the use of color.</p></li>
                                <li><p>Files/folders can be associated with more than one label.</p></li>
                            </ol>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <p>I drafted the following user flows based on the the labelling system developing in my mind. The idea was to used color-coded labels so that users could have a visual cue with which to identify the files and folders on their app.</p>

                    <h3>Branding</h3>
                    <p>I worked on the branding concurrently with the the wireframes. I developed the brand around the word Snapsack, a play on the word “knapsack” and the phrase “It’s a snap”, referencing the simplicity of the app and how easily accessible files and folders are with the new labeling system.</p>

                            <p>I drew a few parallels between the idea of a backpack and cloud storage: a good backpack stores your belongings securely and is meant to be taken with you anywhere. The backpack became the logo, and the user’s storage space became their “Snapsack”.

                    <p>While drawing associations with the backpack mark, imagery of traveling, adventure, and the outdoors formed in my head. The product should feel warm and welcoming; nature isn't always cold and solitary, just as digital products for businesses don't have to be cool and corporate.</p>

                    <h3>Mockups</h3>
                    <p>With the branding guide in place, I could now successfully begin on my mockups. The first thing I did was to apply the various changes I needed to make from testing the wireframes, mostly a rearrangement of a few features.</p>

                    <h4>Dashboard mockup</h4>
                    <img class="border" src="../img/snapsack/dashboard-v1.png" />

                    <div class="focus">
                        <h5>Main changes</h5>
                        <div class="focus-body focus-list">
                            <ul class="list">
                                <li><p><span class="italic">Filter by label</span> moved to top near navigation and above files</p></li>
                                <li><p>Removal of <span class="italic">Add to Snapsack</span> button in favor of placing all upload actions on the sidebar.</p></li>
                                <li><p>Prompt user to choose a folder upon upload.</p></li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <p>I applied Material Design principles for Snapsack’s mobile web app, using a floating action button for the Upload/Create functions and a navigation drawer for access to different parts of the screen.</p>

                    <h4>Mobile mockups</h4>
                    <div class="two-col">
                        <div class="col-1">
                            <img class="border" src="../img/snapsack/mobile-landing.png" />
                        </div>
                        <div class="col-2">
                            <img class="border" src="../img/snapsack/mobile-dashboard.png" />
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <p>In terms of interaction, I added another subtle way of encouraging users to organize their files: upon upload, the user would have the option of adding a label and then be prompted to select a folder into which the item be uploaded.</p>

                    <h4>Select a folder dialog</h4>
                    <img class="small-img" src="../img/snapsack/folder-select.png" />
                </div>
