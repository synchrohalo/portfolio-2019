                    <p>To scope out the competition I selected two cloud storage platforms I was familiar with: Google Drive and Dropbox.

                    <p>I also saw that there was <em>no way to organize files in any other way than by moving them between folders (and by selecting folder colors in Drive)</em>. Could I improve a cloud storage app on this front? This fact was pertinent to my growing interest in how to encourage people to organize their digital spaces.</p>

                    <p>I developed the brand around the word Snapsack, a potential app name I had in mind early on. The name <em>Snapsack is a play on the word “knapsack” and the phrase “It’s a snap”</em>, a reference to the simplicity of the app and how easily accessible files and folders are with the new labeling system.</p>

                    <p><em>The idea of the backpack lent itself to a few metaphors to cloud storage</em>: a good backpack stores your belongings securely and is meant to be taken with you anywhere. The backpack became the logo, and the user’s storage space became their “Snapsack”.</p>

                    <p>I began making more associations with the backpack, my first thoughts being that of <em>traveling, adventure, and nature</em>. Imagery of the outdoors were forming in my head. It was at this time that I decided the product should feel warm and welcoming; nature isn't always cold and solitary, just as digital products for businesses don't have to be cool and corporate.</p>

This was consistent with earlier wireframe problems regarding the proximity of Edit labels with the files.</p>
                    <p>Another interesting point brought up during testing was that <em>using multiple labels to filter files was probably not a common use case.</em> I admit I might’ve been thinking about it in terms of other disciplines, imagining files as databases that might need a distinction between a union or selection of queried data.

                            <li><p><em>Establishing goals for survey writing is important.</em> “Cloud storage app” is a vague term, and my survey reflected that I, too, was unsure of which direction to take with my project. As a result, my survey was weak, and the results I got revealed too many gaps of information that I had to “fill in” myself by making assumptions about my audience.</p></li>
                            <li><p><em>Proximity is key.</em> People are more likely to associate two separate items if they are in close proximity with one another. It’s a basic principle of design, but it can be easy to forget when dealing with a large application.</p></li>
                            <li><p><em>Don’t use too many components in Figma.</em> Though specific to the design tool I used, this proved to be detrimental to my progress, as Figma was not meant to handle this amount of components and nesting. When designing my high-fidelity mockups, I nested components within components so that my working file would be as modular as possible (think classes in object-oriented programming). As a result, copying one screen took the app upwards of 2 minutes to complete, and loading each screen of my prototype was painfully slow as well.</p></li>

                            <li><p><em>Conduct more follow-up research about cloud storage app users and their organization habits.</em> I feel that my survey data wasn’t sufficient due to low participant numbers and lack of foresight regarding the direction the product would take. </p></li>
                            <li><p><em>Consider options on making labels accessible.</em> At the moment, labels are entirely reliant on the user’s ability to perceive colors accurately.</p></li>

                    <p>In spite of the setbacks, the positive comments I received post-testing reaffirmed that I was doing something right. <em>A labeling system is a relatively simple feature that cloud storage apps could use to encourage their users to keep their digital spaces neat.</em> Folders are “enough” but provide very little in the way of visual cues or non-linear access to files. Filtering by labels could be the answer to finding files easily.</p>
